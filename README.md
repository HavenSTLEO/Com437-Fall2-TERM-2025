WEEK1-5 Update 
Green Is Their Favorite Color – Eco Shopping Assistant

Course / Term

Course: COM-437 – Mobile Application Development

Term: Fall 2, 2025

Student: Haven Greene

Project Description This Android app helps shoppers quickly identify more eco-friendly products. Users can search items, view a simple sustainability rating, and save greener choices for future purchases. The goal is to provide clear, non-technical guidance that supports greener shopping habits.

Problem Addressed Shoppers are overwhelmed by confusing “green” labels and marketing. It is hard to know which products are genuinely better for the environment. There is no simple, fast way to compare sustainability while standing in the store. The app solves this by showing a quick rating (for example, a 1–5 “leaf” score or color code) plus a short explanation of why a product earned that rating.

Platform Native Android app Target OS: Android 10+ Devices: Standard Android smartphones Tools: Android Studio, Kotlin or Java (per course requirements) Front-End / Back-End Support Front-End

Android XML layouts following Material Design guidelines Activities and/or Fragments for each major screen RecyclerView for lists (products and favorites) Back-End

Phase 1 (Course Scope): Local mock data (JSON file or Room database) Business logic for rating calculation and basic filtering Phase 2 (Future Enhancement): Optional REST API for real sustainability data Possible cloud backend (e.g., Firebase) Functionality Core features planned for this term:

Home screen with search and category shortcuts Product list screen with name, mini rating, and category Product detail screen with: Product name, brand, and category Sustainability rating (icon/score) Short “Why this rating?” explanation “Add to Favorites” button Favorites screen for saved products Info/Tips screen with simple greener-shopping tips Stretch goals (if time allows):

Barcode scanning to look up products Comparison view between two products Design and Wireframes Wireframes will be:

Hand-drawn first (as required by the course) Recreated using an online tool (e.g., Figma, Balsamiq, or similar) Planned screens:

Splash / Welcome screen Home screen (search + categories + bottom navigation) Product list screen Product detail screen Favorites screen Info / Tips screen Repository Usage This repository will be used to:

Store the Android Studio project for the app Maintain this README as the high-level outline Link to the GitHub Wiki, where more details (design, requirements, progress) will be documented
